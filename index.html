        <p class="text-muted">Starbucks mission to inspire and nurture the human spirit extends well beyond our
          customers, partners and cafes. We take pride in conducting business responsibly and supporting communities
          where we do business, from bean to cup. As a company that buys three percent of the world’s coffee, sourced
          from more than 400,000 farmers in more than 30 countries, Starbucks understands our future is inextricably
          tied to the future of farmers and their families.

          The cornerstone of our ethical sourcing approach to buying coffee is Coffee and Farmer Equity (C.A.F.E.)
          Practices, which was one of the coffee industry’s first set of ethical sourcing standards when it launched in
          2004. Developed in collaboration with Conservation International, C.A.F.E. Practices is a verification program
          that measures farms against economic, social and environmental criteria, all designed to promote transparent,
          profitable and sustainable coffee growing practices while also protecting the well-being of coffee farmers and
          workers their families and their communities. C.A.F.E. Practices has helped Starbucks create a long-term
          supply of high-quality coffee and positively impact the lives and livelihoods of coffee farmers and their
          communities. The open-sourced program consists of more than 200 indicators – from financial reporting to
          protecting workers’ rights and conserving water and biodiversity. The program includes a third-party
          verification process that is overseen by SCS Global Services, responsible for ensuring the quality and
          integrity of the audits.</p>

        <p>You should have a minimal previous understanding of the story, or you will miss 40% of the fun. You should
          watch Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther, Age of Ultron, Ant-Man and the Wasp before watching Avengers:
          Endgame. The entire movie pays homage to most of the other Marvel superhero movies. You will enjoy it a lot.
          There is, at the beginning of the movie, a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. The
          movie is based on the most-talked action-packed Sci-fi series. The movie shows how the Avengers assemble once
          more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore balance to the universe. The movie is lengthy, and it
          does run for 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>
